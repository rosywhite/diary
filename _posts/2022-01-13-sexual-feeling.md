dear diary,

its been really wild to film 5 pretty intense videos in the last two weeks

... the energy lately ...

so, if I cum a couple times, i've typically always felt satisfied for a few days or more. i can even feel satisfied for a week or more after cumming a ton in one sesh (like 5-10x+)

i did have a period of intense research into smut when i was 20ish. it was about a year-long burning desire learning about so many different sexual things. i have really fond memories of those days

lately though, it's that deep throbbing that starts back up again soon after cumming plus my clit has been so swollen which I haven't really ever experienced honestly. i find myself swollen all over too & so wet, daydreaming about fantasies, watching smut videos, & pleasuring myself again and again even if i'm feeling raw cause it just feels that good

idk how long it will last, but it's crazy, i feel like i understand why the term nymphomaniac exists now lol

i'm so happy and i'm lucky to be able to keep this diary of it. i'm thinking of filming whenever i feel like and then aiming to post on thursdays and saturdays for some sanity and a routine haha

love,
