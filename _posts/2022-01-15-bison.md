dear diary,

happy full moon :)

it's the wolf moon, apparently because it's more likely to hear wolves howling in january :)

it makes me feel completely free to say the diary entry 'meta-mental model for a golden age of humanity' does not belong to me :) it's timeless and has the logical structure of time explanation in it too :)

the field of physics often tries to explain, what is time? is it like space, like einstein's spacetime? or is it a series of conscious moments, like each discrete state step by step in quantum mechanics? i'm not sure what time is, but i have learned the hard way, it's been good for me to be truthful about time. i try to be careful how to reasonably make good on promises i make to the future. this is because the future is a "time" :) more in the post :)

i feel free, because if i ever become evil through unfortunate circumstance, i pray the universe gives me a quick and honorable death :) and the timeless truth in that post belongs not to me, but everyone by birth right because it's an idea and ideas are free. the mental model is in there, we can all easily use it and a lot of people i know are like 99.99% superhero already anyway lol

one of the comedy styles of life can be a game show about who can get more wise/wealthy/famous/beautiful/powerful/unattached as we regrow the continents and the oceans :)

imagine the emotion you'd feel in 75 years to see half a billion bison roaming the west ✨💧🔥🌍🌬

game on ha 💃🎶🥳

love,
rosy
