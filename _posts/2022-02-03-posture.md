one arm behind your back

chin up :)

then switch arms

i enjoy this posture from when i worked as a bar back. i would lay a napkin over my front arm and then other arm in back

you can massage your central back muscles with your knuckles

but if you massage, preferably do not use muscles for rest of day and just lay down and sleep for the night 

you by my knee napping or gaming in a cozy posture 

half curled up in a blanket 

half chest-puffed-out, confident, great ape, stretch out your chest and neck, learn all your muscles, massage your whole body, get inverted safely, stretch arms overhead, hang on something like a beam or door sill, laid-back , take care manipulating and cracking joints if you haven't stretched first, yoga is enlightenment for the body, just takes practical enlightenment to have the self-care practical time to heal, take it slow, our body is skeletal/muscle/lymph/nerve/plumbing/eletrical system, emotional/life trauma can be like a concussion / traumatic brain injury, dark cool quiet, healthy fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals, fiber, vegetables for the brain to heal, time heals, shoulders back, chin up,anti-gravity, standing in the upright and alert plane of existence, posture like a soccer player stretching before/after practice 

you right by me

you playing skyrim 
take your time
when you're ready
read this for a questline i didnt complete
i used a 2-handed axe and button mashed for a long time
then i couldn't easily retrain to a mage
but i did collect a lot of plants
did some alchemy
made some weak and regular healing and mana potions
i tried some fire and electric and water mage spells 
please go to the mage university up north
learn elemental spells,
fire bending,
water bending,
ice bending,
learn alchemy/botany (earth-bending),
dragon-borne (airbending)
there's also a bard college of music :)

your submissive posture 

elemental

comfortable / cozy (in Dutch: "gezellig")

quality time together vibing out 

and for you

a comfortable, laid-back office / gamer studio

super comfy floor mats/mattresses

pillows, blankets, yoga bolsters, medicine ball, standing desk, electric blanket, kanteen with hot water, air conditioning, the rumbling vibrations of civilization & the earth :)

nap time :)

then one arm behind your back :)

switch arms :)

chin up :)
