i wanted to write this right away, because after re-reading my last post, depending on how you read it, my tone may seem unclear and i don't want people to think i was feeling blame or anger while i was writing it. i was feeling love and compassion <3. i'm working on a simple definition of true love. we both tried so hard and i believe we were equally as selfless, equally as right. life strategy is really difficult

i think the six pillars is a good life strategy and i only created/discovered it ~12 months ago. this last year, i haven't valued each pillar equally, and so i'm not sure i've acted wisely since i think i valued power and wealth too much the last year instead of beauty, fame, wealth, power, renunciation, wisdom equally

a fair trade in true love is putting in equal pace and effort, but it's a more nuanced story. its the responsibility of both people to ensure a fair trade, not ever just the blame of one person. and i've been working too hard and workaholism i think is a pathology. i did not value the six pillars equally since i learned them. i valued wealth and power more trying to catch up. and a year of lagging on the wisdom/renunciation path can really make me do a lot of unconscious things and mistakes. i'm so sorry for the mistakes but i'm writing this in good spirits knowing that we've respected each other on a fundamental unconditional-love level 

i know i can trust him because we were friends for so long before that. i know he's a good person who respects and loves me and means well. but even meaning well isn't enough. the strategy and mental models matter too :) 

i just recorded a podcast-style audio clip explaining the six pillars, a simple definition of true love, the full proof of love, and its really not polished yet, so maybe i will get to make a video of it next month for youtube

i hope the story of my friend/lover and me is a proof of true love. we tried so hard to be true love and hopefully through the experience generated a mental model--the six pillars--that is a simple definition of love 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
