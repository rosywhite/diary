TL;DR: explaining mental model progression from ape (survival of the fittest vs symbiosis) on their way to human and beyond ðŸ›¸

pic 1: the ape manual (work in progress) ðŸ›¸
  to explain more about what survival strategy means: 
   --what option would someone take in a hand-to-hand combat? 
   --how someone would act in the worst-case scenario of the lives?
   --how do people act when they're breaking down?
   --refer to the famous lawful/chaotic/good/evil chart
   --programmed into us from ape, we inherited either one or a blend of these strategies
