? true love == 

when the sacred bond btw two people is a blend of the six pillars

& they value the six pillars equally, ideally on a daily basis 



six pillars: power, wealth, fame, beauty, wisdom, renunciation



power: having the privilege to make decisions

wealth: including all valuable things, not just money. & what is actually valuable?

fame: value business strategies such as marketing and community ethos such as throwing good parties, etc.

beauty: philosophy has a whole branch called aesthetics

wisdom: golden rule to self and others; upholding fair trade for benefit of both parties

renunciation: the core renunciation is not identifying with just the mind. 
really you are the observer of your mind and your body too. 
awareness is keeping a bit of consciousness always in your body too, not just your mind. 
another way to say it: the core renunciation is renouncing thought and remembering to be here now and feel the senses. 
we are not just the processor of the thoughts and it's good to process the senses (the input) properly :).
take it one conscious breath at a time. 
and if you forget, just start over, one breath at a time. 
when it's safe to :)



can all life strategies can be described with the six pillars?

mastering the power, wealth, fame, etc. branches is like winning the game of the world and being the coolest, most loved celebrity on earth.
mastering the wisdom and renunciation life paths is like hacking the matrix and becoming one with the source lol
can you do both?
game on lol 
because if you win, everyone wins :)

it's like becoming the most good and cool muggle ever and also becoming the most good and cool wizard ever 

both muggles and wizards can be either good or evil ofc

? local dmt cluster <--> golden age of humanity ?


if someone can get to an unlimited level of the six pillars, that's the definition of a golden age. 
it's a hypothetical that describes the necessary conditions for one imagined path towards a golden age. 
if what i'm saying doesn't feel like pure, unconditional love, then it probably isn't.

sending love to all beings

and if you're wondering how i discovered/synthesized the six pillars, it's a long story and you probably wouldn't believe me lol

but essentially was from studying the mental models of business, truth, nature, and consciousness

so i don't have a proof of true love (like i mentioned last post), cause i think that means it would have to work out
but at least i think i have a definition

even if this is all i get to experience of true love, i just hope this leads to harmony and unconditional, pure love for other people

wishing everyone love <3
