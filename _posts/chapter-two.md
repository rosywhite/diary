Dear diary,

Mood: chill
TL;DR: update on my bus, my relationship status, my plans for filming

Today is Christmas. Iâ€™ve got my new home, the Skoolie, in a spot for the winter where I can film :) I need to set up the curtains I have and I should be ready to start filming again :)

I almost filmed this week but it didnâ€™t feel quite right. To be honest, I went through a breakup in September, which is why I moved. As you can see, I had a ton of faith it would work out even as recently as comments I made on here last week. And I guess I couldnâ€™t accept reality for the last few months since I really believe itâ€™s true love, or I guess some breakups take time to fully reach closure. This week I finally had to accept he really just wants to be friends. And we had a great friendship for a couple years before we started dating, so now itâ€™s back to that, which is really nice. Iâ€™m just lucky to have experienced it, cause I deeply believe it was true love, and this year has been the most growth of my life. Iâ€™ve reached really high highs and discovered mental models that honestly seem flawless, which seems totally crazy to say haha. In the next year, Iâ€™m excited to reach those highs more sustainably with a solid daily routine and to walk the walk and test out these mental models. I want to finally start my own business after being an engineer at three startups. Iâ€™m so excited to see if I feel comfortable filming again and this grows, Iâ€™m excited to code up that decentralized subreddit idea I posted last week to see what happens :)

The hard part about filming for me lately is that most all my fantasies are about a story arc with a lover. And without a lover, I donâ€™t have sexual feeling. Itâ€™s been really difficult to decide what to do, but since my ex has insisted, I really do feel itâ€™s okay, and the right thing for me to move on. I did actually go on a date this week, which was really exciting beforehand but painful after when there wasnâ€™t a sexual spark for me. There are a few more people Iâ€™m talking to and considering dating too. I did have a sexual spark with one guy, so it would be actually super exciting if that works out. Then I would be really excited to work on booty training and edging again in this next season :) and I guess if I donâ€™t find a new lover to explore a fantasy storyline with, then maybe Iâ€™ll make some comedy type content like I mentioned before ha

So, Iâ€™ve got to update my bio on here and on the hub and update my pinned post on love. But I do really want to keep this a diary about my own fantasies and I really like those boundaries Iâ€™ve set. Iâ€™m not trying to use ofans or the hub to find partners with which to explore fantasies. I donâ€™t really feel comfortable meeting someone on here because I donâ€™t want to give out my location. I feel way more comfortable seeking people out myself in my area. And I really like exploring fantasies with my lovers. Iâ€™ve been into other things before, but right now just not really into exploring peopleâ€™s fantasies other than a lover. So, please donâ€™t be offended that Iâ€™m not interested in meeting someone via ofans or the hub. Just had to update you here because I really want my content to be authentic.

I am still super into exhibitionism and sharing on here about my adventures into diving deep with lovers. I love slowly exploring deep fantasy story lines â€¦ ðŸ¤¤ and excited to see if I get to do that in 2022 :) No worries if not though haha then Iâ€™ll hopefully get a lot of presence and coding at least :)

Thanks for coming along for the ride!

Love,
Rosy
