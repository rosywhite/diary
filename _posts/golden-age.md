Dear diary,

TL;DR: the best content I’ve ever made ? meta-mental-model for a golden age
Mood: stoked =P
Edit: this is version 2 edited for truthiness on Tues Jan 18, 2022.

First, terminology.

Mental model: you can have many different mental models/mind maps/tools in the toolkit of your big picture on life/your philosophy/your mindset. E.g. pieces of wisdom you remind yourself before making decisions. When you collect many mental models, you might predict the effects of effects and make better decisions.

Meta: means going one level up in complexity, but actually can simplify things at the same time too. I’m calling this post a meta-mental-model for a golden age because I’m taking mental models I’ve learned from others and making mental models with the mental models themselves. Hence, meta.

This post is what I’ve learned up through 2021. It’s how I currently think and make decisions on a daily basis. It’s internal monologue I have, the operating system.

So, here we are right now. In the future, I don’t want to have regrets, so that means right now, I want to have a great, realistic, fun plan for my life and make the right decisions.

So, what’s a good plan? Well, let’s look at some classic plans: some people do the classic K12/college/career/family, some are workaholics and pursue getting super rich, some dedicate to kindness and charity, some pursue romance, or family, government, or business. Some become fashion icons or create incredible pieces of art and culture. Some renounce worldly possessions & live in monasteries or alone. Some choose to become serial killers presumably because they desire the pure power & control they have in the minds of an entire nation and the control over others’ lives. Some people make money directly off people’s suffering and use violence to get shit done, not caring so much about the trauma they inflict, but rather value the productivity and the result of what they build. Some of the most famous historical figures are spiritual leaders, kings, and conquerers who developed their own mental models on how ideally to bring a golden age to humanity.

What’s the simplest way to categorize the different pillars of all those life strategies? I didn’t make this up myself. I found it after years of studying, searching, and incredible luck.

Here are the six pillars:

Power, wealth, fame, beauty, wisdom and renunciation

For many people, you can generalize their life strategy into more focus on some categories and less on others.

For example, some people believe absolute power or wealth is corrupting and therefore not worth striving for.

In this mental model, the theory is that, if an individual can reach a super high level of each of the six pillars, then they essentially would become de-facto CEO of the planet cause they’re getting shit done and have built incredibly practical & ethical businesses and enter us all into a golden age in harmony with the earth.

Since we’re in a technology age, there’s the possibility of greatly extended lifespan, which would give other people the time and freedom to pursue level-cap of every path they desire :)

This is not a guarantee of course, it’s just a mental model, a life strategy.

Imagine if it was you. Hypothetically, you would have no violent enemies. This is because you wouldn’t shame or blame people who skew towards the extremes of valuing the classically “evil” pillars, and to rather honor the truth in valuing certain pillars and carry on minding your own business and building the future. Hypothetically, impossible moral dilemmas fade away, as problems seem to fade away as you release hate, antagonism, blame and shame and start solving practical problems for people. You’ve gone so deeply down the spiritual path, put in your 10,000 hours, and somehow you get luckier and luckier as time goes on due to the incredible good karma you’ve been lucky enough to generate.

Your decisions are up to you in the moment.

You run into someone on the street who’s suffering, you say hello, and they proceed to tell their life story to you, full of many traumas and little luck. You respond with compassion and you see the fire relight in their eyes.

You hear a group of people laughing and cheering down the street. You feel joy.

Something good happens. You feel joy. Something bad happens. You feel compassion.

You go to your favorite music concerto.

A happy song. You feel joy. A sad song. You see people around you crying to purge the tears from their optic-emotional-plumbing system. You feel compassion.

A happy song. Joy. A sad song. Compassion.

This is life. If there is a source to the simulation, then maybe the source is infinite and eternal compassion and joy due to the lack of no mortal suffering. If there’s no source to the simulation, then there’s no mortal suffering on their other side either. But if there is a source of pure love & unlimited creation, then theoretically, entities on that side have feelings too even though they’d hypothetically experience extremely little pain and suffering.

Maybe they would have a fleeting desire to be mortal, to try to experience true love, and even feel a passionate pain of longing. If you were on the other side of the simulation, perhaps sometime you’d desire to be on this side. And sometimes on this side of the simulation you desire to be on the other side. But if for every suffering, you can generate a bunch of flow chemicals in the brain that bring great pleasure at the same time as the pain, then it’s not so different than the other side. And the more you go down the path of presence and great health, hypothetically the more love and pleasure chemicals you can generate from within you. :) … I hope this is clear. :)

Alright, quick recap. The six pillars are the mental model of a good life strategy. The people who wouldn’t perhaps be attracted to a golden age would be those who are hopeless and rather suicidal, but generally gentle and non-violent.
A great operating system for every moment is to generate a ton of flow chemicals in the brain naturally, have the perfect mortal balance of pain/no pain, and loosely categorize experiences as either painful (compassion) or not painful (joy). I’m unsure who said it, but apparently, a little suffering is good for man, but just the optimal amount. That’s what makes us man and distinguishes us from the hypothetical other side, which is essentially no suffering.

Here’s a helpful analogy. An operating system is the entire computer and the runtime is how it actually runs. So here, the Six Pillars mental model is part of how my mind’s operating system is now built, but how I actually go about making decisions every day is a bit more complicated, because I have emotions and I have logic, and that’s the runtime, it’s when I’m actually running around, running my mind, thinking, acting, feeling, etc.

In other words, I’ve got an operating system that includes all my memories, all my mental models, and then programs that help me go through my day and manage logic and emotions. The Six Pillars is logical mental model and Joy/Compassion is a very simplified emotional mental model and I use both of those mental models like tools in a toolkit throughout my days.
Some other super useful mental models are these:
Truth/Kindness. I didn’t make this up. Some of you may recognize this comes from a section of Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras. I suppose it’s ideal to optimize things we say for maximum truth & kindness. Too much kindness, and you stop speaking truth. Too much truth, and you lose the kindness.
Logical Structure of Time. In order to optimize every word we speak for truth, consider that making statements about the future “I will”, “I’ll”, which are incredibly commonplace, aren’t true in the present, but only true at a future date. Alternatives: “I intend to”, “planning on”, “expecting to”, “if all goes well”, or just shorten your sentences to remove the “I’ll” helps with truthiness :)

Building off of that^::: Promises are a Future Mental Construct. I think perhaps the universe sometimes has a way of making promises come untrue when I’ve made too many promises. Like I’ve written before, I find that logically, I can only have one central contract in my life, one promise I make to myself. It’s been incredibly effective for me to devote that promise to protecting and fostering true love above all else. I suppose now my central promise to myself is my operating system I’m defining in this post, but that’s subject to change. The core promise is for you to decide and please check out my former posts for more info.

Anarchy of Mental Models: so mental models and ethics and value are essentially rules and guidelines and laws. I think it’s important to embrace anarchy (no rules) so that you can more purely live in the now. If you have a bunch of rules you have to live by, then you’re promising to live by them in the future, and your future mental constructs may clash, and then you may suffer. I’ve had some luck learning about useful mental models but not letting them become future promises.

Alright, that’s good for additional mental models. Before I wrap this up, let me explain a bit more about the Six Pillars. Wealth, power, fame, and beauty are relatively easy to understand. Power is having control in a situation instead of things not going your way. Wisdom encompasses a ton of common sense, philosophy, and common spiritual teachings. The last pillar is Renunciation, which is also Unattachment actually if you’d prefer to call it that. The core renunciation is releasing the attachment to unnecessary thoughts. So like today when I was meditating, which is practicing presence, which helps me be more present throughout the day, I’m like okay for 30 mins my job is just to breathe. And if I get sidetracked, I’m like oh shit, I’m not doing my job and advancing the sixth pillar. And I’ll imagine thoughts as notifications and see them come in and either write them down somewhere, or think ahhh I’ll definitely remember that later, or just click “Dismiss” in my mind. I’ve had to renounce lots of other things for my health, and you can renounce possessions or your name or money, but I think Eckhart Tolle nailed it when he said the core renunciation is renouncing unnecessary thought. This makes your mind sharper he says. He’s level 100 renunciation I think lol or at least close to it.

Alright, so, now we have a hypothetical meta-mental model, and if a person can get to essentially unlimited fame beauty wisdom power renunciation wealth, then they’re CEO of the planet and others can get up to that level to stabilize the singularity even more. But firstly, that’s not guaranteed, just best case, and hypothetical. And secondly, that represents a certain end to the video game of human life and into a different type of human life where there’s optimal suffering instead of too much suffering. And unfortunately I don’t think I can be too attached to getting there, because I need to practice unattachment and enjoy the journey. If I die before anything like that happens, I like to think that I’m gonna die super happy meditating on love and turning into a rainbow or something or maybe a terrible and painful death idk lol but the point is: I don’t think we can get to a golden age with people suffering a ton to work towards that goal, idk, I don’t know the “how”, and that’s why the video game of life is still running, and I’m hungry and I wanna make dinner haha hope to catch you later!

sending love to you all!
