dear diary,

second diary post of the day :) --- [the first being the pinned post about love]

i've been thinking a lot lately about boundaries and how best to express myself. of course, i've been evolving a lot, and it's been an amazing gift to express myself here on ofans to figure out what i like and who i feel i really am inside :)

i definitely know i'm an exhibitionist haha and also i feel deep inside, i dream of being a great wife someday and to protect my relationship as my priority in life. i'm realizing i love to explore fantasies with my lover and exhibiting them here on ofans, but right now, i honestly don't enjoying hearing other peoples fantasies, whether in messages or comments here or on the hub

that hasn't always been the case, and could change again someday, but today, that's the truth of who i am :)

so, that's an amendment to the prev post i made this morning. and that's okay. if that was my constitution, that was a great foundation, but this is my first amendment. if i get a comment or post about someone else's fantasy, i respectfully don't wish to respond to it, or delete it, or ask politely for them to respect my boundary (which likely they didnt realize i had)

i know it's a bit different than a lot of sex work where it's about others' fantasies, but that's the authentic me right now, and i want to keep my page genuine and real as possible. i do hope to keep posting on here as a diary to express myself. it might be hard to compassionately ask others to respect that boundary, but i think it's worth it, because that's 100% consent going both ways and i believe people have good intentions towards kindness and truth

i've been thinking about it like this. if you saw me and my lover in person, knowing that i'm taken and not open, but that i am an exhibitionist, what would be an awesome thing to say? well, i think it would be awesome if you'd cheer us along and compliment the work. i think that's really positive and respectful and see no problems with that whatsoever :)

you could also make a comment on a business aspect in order to give some advice, or give some general life advice on a blind spot to help me grow as a person, so i can keep doing what i'm doing :)

i super appreciate this wonderful community and thanks so much for giving me the space to evolve and grow. there's absolutely no one to shame or blame, and i'm super grateful for all the positivity :)

thanks for being patient while i've processed all of these thoughts and feelings about love & boundaries i've held for a long time and build that into a business model :) it takes time to build a business haha

i think it's truly my responsibility to express my own boundaries so that no one crosses them. so far, i genuinely don't believe i've encountered one person in my journey who has crossed a boundary that i've set, so i'm very hopeful for the future :)

and thanks all for being so incredibly respectful :)

love,
rosy
