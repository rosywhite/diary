dear diary,

my intention is to be all about love. but how does this apply practically to ofans?

🤍

you may have read my previous diary entries about how i aim to care with love for everyone involved in this little community. e.g.: responding to messages & comments fairly, aiming for a fair-trade & psychologically non-abusive biz model, and being kind and fair to myself and my private life

🤍

i'm very excited today to share my personal (best-version-so-far-but-definitely-evolving) core philosophy/mindset of love ... XD

🔂🤍

i believe love is working towards logical, emotional, and practical enlightenment, linearly, step-by-step, with good habits, celebration, and wisdom. and i believe love is both the journey and the destination 🤍

🤍

so, "enlightenment"? what does this mean? here’s a little story to explain…

🤍

when i was 18, i learned about the mathematical exponentially of the internet & technology and found it such a powerful concept, i decided to become a computer programmer

🤍

i also learned when you plot major events in the history of life itself (e.g.: dna, single-celled organisms, fish coming on land, mammals, Homo sapiens, etc.), it’s an exponential curve

🤍

this caused me to hypothesize that perhaps consciousness is exponential as well (unproven), so that after a certain amount of linear progress towards logical, emotional, and practical enlightenment, you can hypothetically leave the linear part of the curve behind and enter the exponential part of the curve (singularity)

🤍

i'm not going to go into logical and emotional enlightenment much today, but here's my simplest plan for practical enlightenment (copied from my bio today): air, water, food, shelter, wealth, comedy & partying for the people 🌬💧🥩🌱🏡💸🌍🚀🌌🕺🎶

🤍

of course, the plan needs to be good enough to actually be realistic, and is subject to evolve like science & wisdom itself evolve, but that’s the best i have so far

🤍

so, where does ofans come in? i dream that for me, it could open up . a lot of wealth, comedy and partying 😆and i intend to share the love, share the wisdom, and help to unlock levels for you equally along your game of life as you help to unlock mine, fair-trade 🥰🙏

🤍

but wait, that’s not fair if only I get to be the main character of the story, right? well, i believe i can’t reach enlightenment unless everyone does, so it’s actually a teamwork process where we reach the next levels together. and plus, there’s no guarantee of an enlightened singularity

🤍

there are many, many possibilities for the next few decades of humanity, and i’ll focus on two prominent options. worst case: nightmare singularity & best case: enlightened singularity

🤍

to give an example that relates to ofans: worst case, i do something unfair/unethical and I get cancelled and lose a lot of progress I’ve made for myself, and best case: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

🤍

best case enlightened singularity for all of us as whole is that together we unlock everyone feeling like they’re the main character of the story, everyone feeling like they’ve won the lottery every day (as it’s felt for me most days recently, more and more)

🤍

i dream of an abundance of opportunity for everyone to play every quest line of the game of human life we ever dream of and get to live as long as we choose to 🤍🚀

🤍

i haven’t figured out how to explain why I believe so deeply in all this yet, but i do believe a lot of people have worked out a lot of logical, emotional, and practical enlightenment so far. and remember, that’s what i believe love is: taking the right step in the moment, given the right plan

🤍

love is a lot more than just that too. i think love is pleasure, orgasms, laughing out loud, joy, deep compassion, tender loving care, truth, fair-trade, and equality to name a few…

🤍

i believe love is rooted in my core prayers every day, which i’ll let you in on. the core one is “send love to all beings”, defaulting back to just one word, “love”, as a mantra, and actually i sing it :) and it feels really pure and beautiful lol i love it

🤍

because my core prayer is “send love to all beings”, this is why i intend to heart all messages and comments, regardless of text content

🤍

but what if the comment is praising me above others? well, that’s not equality then…

🤍

this is true, but one of my root/secondary prayer above the core is “i pray this is equally about me as it is about everyone”. listen, i think I’m really going through some type of magical something haha and i desperately want that for everyone. also, i desperately want to be friends with the girls on ofans and the hub. i think they’re so awesome and i want to reach enlightened singularity which i dream is, alongside all the regular wholesome life stuff, is a safe, fun, never-ending party/orgy lol

🤍

i definitely never wish to be demanding, controlling or think I’m better, but i would really appreciate if you wouldn’t write comments that seem to elevate me above others because then they might not like me. if you do, no shame or blame or judgement lol ... i hope this is a safe space and that’s hardly an evil action that deserves cancellation lol

🤍

btw, please have no fear of commenting or private messaging haha i really appreciate comments both for the algorithm and i especially love to read funny, kind and/or deep comments, because the comments alone and the tips also give me a boost of brain chems lol and can help me evolve to the next levels

🤍

also, the comments can really help bc only you can see my blind spots bc they’re my … blind … spots … so don’t be afraid to burn away my ego either lol i’m pretty sure I can handle the truth haha

🤍

(this section no longer applies, see bottom of post for lately policy) so, i plan on sticking to my policy of: hearting all public comments on ofans and replying with a 🤍 to all tipped messages in my inbox (typically on saturdays, or throughout the week on work breaks). once again, no matter the public comment, i plan to heart it bc i don’t wish to judge, and i intend to send love to all beings. i still don’t plan on text responding to messages or comments, but if i do feel it’s important to clarify my philosophy of love, then i do plan on commenting on the hub

🤍

thank you very very very much for reading, for subscribing, and for enjoying my smut!

🤍

sending love to all beings 🤍🤍🤍

love,
rosy white

edit 1:

i respectfully ask that people respect the new boundary i have set and respect my consent that i do not wish to hear of others fantasies in comments or messages. tysm :)

TL;DR of it is: if i get a comment or post about someone else's fantasy, i respectfully don't wish to respond to it, or delete it, or ask politely for them to respect my boundary (which likely they didnt realize i had). instead: i think it would be awesome if you'd cheer us along and compliment the work :) (cont. in my second dear diary post Nov 20, 2021)

edit 2: 

more updates in my dec 25, 2021 dear diary post ... i went through a breakup sadly but am not seeking to date people via ofans/the hub for security reasons, thanks for understanding. i really like this to be a diary expressing my fantasies with my lovers so thanks for understanding :)

edit 3:

chapter two has been going really well and i'm really thankful for my submissive :) his energy has made this possible :)
