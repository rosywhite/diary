Dear diary,

I’ve planned the tech stacks to build a website for some smut photos :) first step was making a GitHub account to store the code on the internet.

https://github.com/rosywhite

feel free to keep track of my coding progress. a little calendar shows green when I push code to store it on GitHub (“committing” code).

i could put up those photos from the garden :) i did post some of them to reddit before :) https://www.reddit.com/user/rosy_white

one of the first steps of a new code repository is the code license, either open source or proprietary, etc.

I'm choosing a GPL license. YIKES! Lol... GPL licenses “infect” all code that uses it with free licenses, so you cannot get a proprietary license or patent I believe for code with GPL-licensed software in its tech stack.

i think it would be cool over the next months to live-code a decentralized app (dapp) connecting to different blockchains and also a Shopify app too :)

In other words, it’s a decentralized business shop connected to Shopify (software portal secured by major banks) and two blockchains (like having double backup with two strands of DNA). It’s partly a decentralized business shop and partly a subreddit-type network. It’s a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) built with subsocial/substrate/polkadot. announcing it in the public domain means i cannot patent it, but i cannot patent it anyway because i plan to build on top of GPL-infrastructure codebases

i hope i code something useful people could use for business and fair trade, a utility, and that I could use it for this dream of a fair-trade video-content business model

for the stacks I'm thinking:

frontend: the latest stable in pure vanilla html and css. also javascript/react to create a component library filled with buttons and fonts and tables and colors and grids :) then next.js for routing and state

database: postgreSQL, IPFS, Storj, Twilio, or cloud storage, etc.

blockchain tech stacks would be dApp tech stacks of whatever blockchain you wish

such cool blockchain stuff going on these days :)

And I think it would be cool to have a PG-rated true-love classifieds section, as well as an XXX true-love classifieds :) I’ve got some exciting ideas for boundaries, security, consent and protecting people by pointing them to my totally separate PG identity like a YouTube channel which my parents and grandparents watch .. where I use some mind maps as well as attempts at comedy… but this site here is where I’m doing a logical proof :)

Excited to tinker around with some code :)

Love,
rosy

disclaimer from feb 20, 2022: I now work in the blockchain space and hope this is general enough that there is no conflict of interest.
