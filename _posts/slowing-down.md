Dear diary,

Mood: emo & positive overall; 
TL;DR: I’m in a slow-growth phase, revealing how much I’ve made on ofans, revealing why I haven’t been sharing my fantasies as much lately

…Dear diary,

This week I reached a massive surprise milestone. It’s crazy good to feel stable in mental, emotional, financial and physical health. It feels like I stepped off a rollercoaster I’ve been on for a couple decades but didn’t know I could get off.

I feel I’ve found a small paradise, not the big party yet, but a little island of my own. A life where things are at my pace and I have the true chance to get all my self care done and celebrate. And not just reaching this for a little while, like I have before, but feels like sustainably, probably for the rest of my life.

It’s a life that’s mostly super happy, creative, and not that serious, but very emo at times too, but that’s where compassion comes in to save the day, & I think that’s just being human. It’s also no longer feeling I need to lift heavily to hurry on some code, some content, some income, some health research.

Suddenly, I have the privilege I’ve desperately tried to reach for a couple years. The privilege is being able to take things slow enough to practice presence in every moment.

For me, that means being conscious of every breath if I’m doing something that uses my mind, and if I’m not able to focus on breath, cause I’m eating or talking for example, then to focus on the idea or feeling of love.

I’m not there yet, but now I finally have a routine and life where I have a chance. The more I practice, the easier it gets. Habits.

To be honest, I wasn’t sure I was gonna make it. I think a lot of people can relate to the feeling of tapping life force so deep, hoping to someday wash up on the shores of a better life, a better plan, something that could last the long-haul. It makes me cry to say, for me, someday is today. It makes me cry so bad, cause I bet not many people have felt this feeling, but it’s happy tears to know it’s even possible :)

I have the opportunity, finally, to train to be consciously aware for every moment, as I remain a computer programmer with business dreams of solving more of air, food, water, shelter, wealth, comedy and partying for the people. :) Yeah, sometimes the suffering gets so bad, I wish for the future. But lately, time seems like it’s moving more and more at exactly the pace it should.

I plan on taking ofans a lot more slowly right now unfortunately. I’m very sorry if the pace disappoints you. There are a few reasons.

Firstly, I’m not making very much money on here. I’m super happy with my business model hypothetically over the long term, but it’s slow growth, & only made $486 gross profit/$388.80 net revenue before taxes since Aug 3, 2021. If you share my content and help me grow, I’d be very happy to make more videos.

I’m soooo fucking excited to film in my new home (the skoolie) because it’s so cute and vibey, but it requires a lot of work, time, logistics, and money to make that happen right now, and I really want to take things slow and focus on presence.

About a month ago, I made a tough decision to quit at the startup where I had been a founding engineer, for personal reasons, one of which because I was sacrificing my health way too much. Thankfully, I’m insanely lucky, I’ve been interviewing for part-time opportunities with some crazy cool tech companies. Hopefully I get one of them, and I’m so lucky that part-time covers my bills :)

As you can see, I just exited a super hustle high-growth, high-chaos, high-energy push that’s been going on for a long time, and now entering a slow-growth phase, focusing on stability. Yeah, would be awesome if I quickly multiply my income without much extra work. That would open up new opportunities for me, but I’m super happy where I’m at.

Another reason I want to slow down is, my sexual feelings have been evolving so much lately and it makes my cry a lot to think on how powerful this has been in my life. It’s really hard for me to share it right now. Maybe you can understand how intense fantasies can be.

You’ve probably noticed in my videos, I have been keeping my fantasies to myself more and more. It feels that something so real and profound is happening, but only with lots of tender loving care, no rush, and a delicate touch :)

I want to take things slow and do things right :) so if/when I get out in the skoolie, I’m really stable and I have a super clean healthy hygienic setup :) I dream to build & cultivate my sexual energy so I can really explore more :)

So for now, I’d really like to review my video content for a while and make more quick edits. Reviewing my stuff helps make me stay true to who I am. I think quick edits could help me grow on the hub and help me share my story better too. And of course, I plan to keep writing these dear diaries on love, etc.

Thanks for coming along for the ride.

Love,
Rosy
