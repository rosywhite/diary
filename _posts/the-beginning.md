Dear diary,

Mood: inspiring / very deep emo
TL;DR: my backstory of love; what is actually worth something? existentialism, nihilism, absurdism, logical proofs, proof of stake/proof of work

…Dear diary,

What is the deepest desire of my heart?

A longing to reach a practical, logical golden age on earth full of wonderful, fun, challenging experiences and along the way, to explore the world with my friends, family & true love… :)

I think that dream has been deep in my heart, driving me all these years :)

Today I want to begin to tell a story, with the intention that the story itself is (the beginning of) a mathematical and logical proof of sorts. A proof of what? /// I’ll get into more later, but I can say some of the core questions are… what is true love? What is actually valuable? What’s actually meaningful? And how do we get there? ;-)

Trigger warning, this story gets very deep very quick. If deep is the not the vibe for you atm, np, I’ve got some comedy planned for my next smut video. Please be kind to yourself and let yourself rest

Growing up, it seemed I had all the gifts. Essentially perfect childhood. Teenage years got weird since we are warmongering apes turning into digi-apes, but essentially I was a whiz kid who could compute and solve problems rapidly, so without many problems of my own to solve and no childhood trauma, I luckily got a lot of time to spin cycles on how to solve the world’s practical problems. I’ve essentially had the freedom to study, to party, and to decompress/heal as much as I’ve wanted to for all of my life. And I deeply desire that for everyone, because that’s what privilege essentially is.

I was barely bullied, but I do remember other people bullying/getting bullied in school, and seeing the effects on both sides of that made me profoundly sad. Anger made me feel very scared, but it was extremely, extremely rare for me to encounter. I developed classical teenage depression seeing the suffering of the world and wanted to solve everything. Luckily, I seem to be extremely good at solving problems.

In high school, I studied extensively into truth, consciousness, meaning, etc. … I remember the incredible euphoria of the moment of discovery that there was a word for what we had been secretly calling “revelations” in my texts with a friend , it was called “philosophy”. There was a well-worn path of others who had pursued some sort of solid logical ground to stand on in this world of paradoxes, contradictions, confusing truths, this world of darkness, suffering, danger, but also world of comedy, music & love :) I decided I believed in a mix of existentialism, nihilism and absurdism. I felt compelled by the question, what is the meaning of existence? but due to logical contradictions, I couldn’t find a non-paradoxical value system/philosophy, and so therefore I believed in nothing, because I couldn’t find any truth to hold onto long enough before it changed under my feet …still, even if ideologically I had no hope, I didn’t stop searching and learning, compelled because maybe, I just hadn’t solved it all yet? Like I mentioned in the pinned post about love, when I was 18, I became extremely optimistic about “making the world a better place” practically with the exponential power of computer programming and the internet. I partied a lot, chilled out a lot, studied a lot, had a lot of great experiences and experienced true love, which was extremely comforting and worthwhile, and made it bearable to get through the hopelessness and confusion.

Tw: it’s about to get deep, pivoting into a tragic true love story from my youth … …. ….. ….. …. spoiler alert: that friend I used to text philosophy with, it was with him that I first experienced true love. we were friends for about six years, and we began a relationship in college, but soon after we began, he died (likely suicide). We never even kissed, but we did have one romantic hug and what felt like a lifetime of discovering philosophy, poetry, music, etc., together.

We spent a fair chunk of time trying to decide what we wanted to become since it seemed all the doors of possibility were open before us. I remember he had this brilliant idea of writing a “didactic philosophical novel” where the core messages that, in the face of hopelessness, maybe life is worth living because of romantic true love. I just broke down in deep tears recalling this, and just realizing for the first time, maybe I’m starting to write the didactic philosophical book right now? This is an autobiographical story, not novel, though. Well, I miss him every day, and sorry to say, after about a decade, he’s still extremely dead in this mortal plane haha shit … and I miss him so much ‘cause I have him to thank for largely building who I am. It seemed he could see farther than I could. He could solve problems beyond my capabilities. He was a gentle teacher and a wonderful human being who intended not to cause suffering.

So why am I telling you this? Because, I feel I’ve completed the proof in my head of logical/emotional/practical enlightenment, but I still need to write it down and explain it. Oddly enough, I hope telling this story is a bit of the proof. Why?

A proof proves something of value. So what’s actually valuable in life? What is the deepest desire of the heart?

Relationships are valuable. Having someone with you for the highs and lows is valuable, it can really add to both lives. That’s the romantic in me :)

Other than relationships, money is one main way we represent value in society. Did you know, cryptocurrencies are typically defined by mathematical whitepapers/“proofs”. Disclaimer: I have never owned any cryptocurrency but have donated free computing power to ethereum in like 2015 & I worked in crypto this year, which I no longer do. Back to the point, in whitepapers, the coin-creators intend to logically & mathematically prove economic concepts based on human nature, including incentives to gain wealth and enrich others. In order to build a little business community that collectively invests in these digital coins, there needs to be consensus on what the coin actually is in code and how to keep defining it in the future when it gets traded around. Two main ways to do that are proof of work and proof of stake, with some new chains using proof of history(time), and ot concepts floating around like proof of authority or proof of replication, etc. … so now having said that, I can sound a lot more logically reasonable (but not entirely reasonable… yet?) by saying that this story is intended to be a logical proof of true love and that there is a philosophy called enlightenment that can be explained logically, it’s just a rather long proof but I’ve got to start somewhere lol

Alright, so I’ve told the story of how I discovered true love, but lost it before it really begun. And for many years, I thought maybe I had found true love, and it’s not to say it wasn’t, I had incredible soulmate connections, but I think they would readily agree that we weren’t the ones for each other, and some of them have found theirs :) But I got really lucky, really really really lucky, and found true love again last year :)

It’s incredibly precious. How can I protect it? What logical philosophy is sound enough to be true? Well, making things a priority is a great place to start. The root of “priority” is from Latin, and means “before”. So in life, you get one chance to put something #1, before everything else, and everything else come after. This is true contractually and legally. For example, think about the stock market or cryptocurrency. There are many contracts in investments and business that certain people get paid certain amounts, but if the money runs out, if the market crashes, you must default on many contracts in their worst case scenarios, but there were still some contracts that hypothetically didn’t default. Another example, you can disappoint many people in your life and break promises, but never break a core promise to yourself, for example.

So with true love, I think maybe it’s making that the central contract of your life. Knowing that you would default on all other promises before you would break your vows, but that likely they wouldn’t contradict if you build securely. And there are ways to think about how to withstand the “in sickness” parts, too. Here are best- and worst-case scenarios, for example: Even if things aren’t going well, but you both are still dedicated, you can still be loyal and wait for many years, writing love poems or some other great proof of love without manipulation or violation of boundaries, teaching each other your souls. And if you’re deep in the questline of attempting to heal their evil/power demons from the matrix, you might even be crazy enough to reverse-cheat on them where you tell them you’re gonna move on since they told you to but then really don’t haha … that’s worst case of course, but very noble and romantic lol, and best case is that logical and emotional enlightenment isn’t so far away as it seems :) … so you see that might give you hope that emotional/logical/practical enlightenment are possible if we can all work together … and here I am trying to logically prove it by telling this story of love and explaining logical systems of priority, value, contracts, etc. haha wow I have such a dirty mind XD

Well, I think that’s plenty for the day :) I’m a bit tired and I intend to make some dinner :)

Love is a beautiful thing :) and who knows… maybe following it might just save the world … ? XD

But you’d have to be crazy to believe that before I finish the proof ;)

Here’s to romantic dreams of laying naked on beaches with my lover watching the sunset 🤍

love,
